	which has the default css's for all the application.
	
	You can define custom css for a particular page defining
	the view.yml in your apps/frontend/modules/card/config/view.yml
	
	there are many configuracions:
	1) The global -> for the project (in config/)
	2) The local  -> for the application (in apps/APP/config/)
