Routing
http://www.symfony-project.org/reference/1_4/en/10-Routing

This file contains the definition of the routes in the application,
it works the same as the struts-config.xml in struts.

When a request comes in, the routing system tries to match a route to the incoming URL. 
<<Important>>: The first route that matches wins!

When the routing.yml configuration file is read,
each route is converted to an object of class class
